     <div id="history">
       Waterskiing was invented in 1922 by Ralph Samuelson. He used a pair of wooden boards as skis and a clothesline as his rope.
       Since then, waterskiing has evolved into a worldwide sport. Millions of dollars have been spent into innovating the design
       of the skis and the boats for optimal performance. So much so that the sport of skiing was divided into 3 separate events:
       slalom, trick, and jump. Each of which are described in detail in the links below.
