      <h2><span>About</span></h2>
      <p>
        In competition slalom waterskiing, skiers must traverse a slalom course consistent of entrance gates, 6 bouys
        spaced out evenly alternate sides, and exit gates. The skiers must complete a pass through the course by going
        through both sets of gates and around all 6 bouys in order to advance to the next more difficult pass. Every
        completed pass the skier makes the rope gets shorter or the boat speed increases. Once the skier reaches the
        division max speed, the rope gets shorter every pass. The rope starts out at 75 feet long. The skier with the
        most bouys at the shortest line length is the declared the winner. The world record for men in this event is
        2.5 @ 43off (43 feet shortened off the 75 foot starting line), set by Nate Smith of the United States. The
        world record for women in this event is 3.5 @ 41off, set by Regina Jaquess of the United States.
