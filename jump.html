      <p>
        In competition waterski jumping, participants cut as hard as they can at a jump that stands anywhere from 5 to 6 feet tall,
        depending on what division the are in, to try to fly the farthest off the top of the ramp. The skier who lands the farthest
        away from the ramp is declared the winner. The skier is allowed 3 attempts at the jump and must ride away from the jump for
        it to count. The world record in this event for men is 254 feet, set by Ryan Dodd of Canada. The world record in this event
        for women is 198 feet, set by Jacinta Carroll of Australia.
