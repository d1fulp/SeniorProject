        About: Nate Smith is without a doubt the most
               dominant slalom skier over the last 5 years.
               He jumped onto the scene very early winning
               many junior titles. His dominance continued
               through the pro ranks due to his extremely
               smooth and consistent style. He rarely ever
               looses which is something especially difficult
                in waterskiing.
