      <p>
        In competition trick waterskiing, each skier has two, twenty second passes of tricks. Each trick is worth a certain preset amount
        of points. There are 5 judges that view and score your run through video feed. They score based on whether or not the trick was
        done correctly. So the skier either gets all the points for a trick or none. No partial credit. Skiers cannot repeat tricks and
        only 6 flips are allowed to be performed in one ski ride. If a skier falls during the first pass, that is the end of the pass,
        and the skier must advance to the next pass. If the fall occurs in the second pass, the skier is not allowed to continue. The skier
        that scores the most points is declared the winner. The world record for men in this event is 12570 points, set by Alaiksei Zharnasek
        of Belarus. The world record for women in this event is 10610 points, set by Anna Gay of the United States.
